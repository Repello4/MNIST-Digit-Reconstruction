# MNIST Image Reconstruction and Gap Statistic Methodology

## Project Overview

This project consists of two main components:

1. **MNIST Image Reconstruction**: A deep learning approach to reconstructing images from the MNIST dataset using various techniques.
2. **Gap Statistic Methodology**: An exploration and implementation of the Gap statistic for determining the optimal number of clusters in clustering algorithms.

## Installation

To set up this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
## Usage

### MNIST Image Reconstruction

1. **Jupyter Notebook**:
   - Open the [`MNIST_Image_Reconstruction.ipynb`](MNIST_Image_Reconstruction.ipynb) file in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
   - Run the notebook cells to see the image reconstruction process and results.

2. **LaTeX Document**:
   - The [`MNIST_Image_Reconstruction.tex`](MNIST_Image_Reconstruction.tex) file contains a detailed report of the reconstruction methods and results. Compile it using a LaTeX editor to generate the PDF document.

### Gap Statistic Methodology

1. **PDF Report**:
   - The [`Gap_Statistic_Methodology.pdf`](Gap_Statistic_Methodology.pdf) file provides a comprehensive overview of the Gap statistic method, including its purpose, algorithm versions, and simulation results.

## Files and Directories

- **MNIST_Image_Reconstruction.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook with code for image reconstruction using the MNIST dataset.
- **MNIST_Image_Reconstruction.tex**: LaTeX file detailing the image reconstruction methods and results.
- **MNIST_Document.pdf**: PDF document summarizing the MNIST Image Reconstruction project.
- **Gap_Statistic_Methodology.pdf**: PDF document explaining the Gap statistic method for cluster analysis.
